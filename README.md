# alt-tap.rb: An alternative version of `brew tap`

## WARNING ##

**This is alpha software. Use it at your own risk. It is very alpha.**

## What is it?

It's an [external command][ec] for [Homebrew][brew]. It is meant to be
a replacement for the built-in [`brew tap`][bt] command. That command has
certain limitations, but because of backwards compatibility, it's hard to
update.

This command is born of my desire for a souped-up version of brew tap. To
that end, I have freely borrowed (ahem, stolen) code from the existing
`brew tap` command. I thank all the people who worked on that command.
